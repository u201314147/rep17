This is a mod that replaces an image in CTR's VRAM with one presented as code, in this case Crash Bandicoot's icon in both the character select screen and arcade races, using the LoadImage function. This is a basic example of how the png2vram tool can be used for sprite and texture replacement. More advanced examples can be found in the NewKartTextures, Retro-Fueled, and CharacterIconAlts modules in order of complexity.
