CharacterIconAlts allows you to change the mugshot icon of the characters in
CTR to those seen in the prototype builds and the Japanese version of the game,
as well as a couple of custom icons made by members of the ctr-tools community.
To change icons, press R2 or L2 while hovering on a character in the character
select screen. Made by Superstarxalien.

Only works in the NTSC-U (926) version of the game (as far as I know).
