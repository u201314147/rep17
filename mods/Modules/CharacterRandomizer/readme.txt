Makes unlockable characters appear as CPUs in races.
Made by Niko.

Supports all builds

The randomizer imports code from OverrideMPK, which allows
any combination of characters to be loaded into any mode, 
at max LOD as well

The code in main.c is executed at the end of SetRobotIDs
for both 1P and 2P arcade, which picks a random driver
for each AI, without touching players
