Time Trial ghost replay

Supports all builds

Replaces regular time trial mode with ghost replay. You
can only watch ghosts that are already on the memory card.

When disabling transparency, drivers appear dark,
this is because of instance->0x22, we'll fix that later

KNOWN ISSUE: Your non-ghost driver will still be present.
