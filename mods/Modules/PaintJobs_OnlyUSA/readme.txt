paint jobs just like in crash team racing nitro-fueled
lets you choose from the 15 original kart colors for any character as well as 6 new ones
to use press l2 or r2 in the character select screen
only works on single player, second third fourth can't change colors

bit of a secret here, the 6 new colors were made to match PS1-era Crash Bandicoot (and other Universal Interactive) characters that aren't playable in the original CTR (and, naturally, are playable in CTRNF)
which ones are which? that's for you to decide (or I could just tell you in the discord server)

SUBMIT COLORS?

yeah that's right I want your colors
it's pretty simple, all you have to do is recolor the textures that you see in the "new colors" folder, then you send those over to the CTR-tools Discord server (https:discord.gg/WHkuh2n) in the #2d-art channel
you can only recolor the textures by changing their colors as indicated by the tiny row below the texture, anything fancier will not be accepted (so that means you can really only recolor the actual colored part, sorry to those who wanted to trick out their exhausts)
if you have paint.net, you can open template.pdn to make things easier
