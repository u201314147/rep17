                                    ABOUT

This mod edits the kart textures for each playable character so the pipe
framing of the karts feature the gold or silver accents as they do in promo
renders of CTR. Made by Superstarxalien.

Penta Penguin's pipe framing in this mod is silver as in Nitro-Fueled, but
it should really be changed to gold since we have a render of Penta from the
original game with gold pipe framing. Shucks.

Only works in the NTSC-U (926) version of the game.

                                TECHNICAL DATA

* This mod compiles to kernel addresses 0xA000 and 0xE400, using 1248 and 1184
bytes for each. This means you may not be able to use this mod with
CharacterIconAlts or Retro-Fueled. You *might* be able to use this with
OxideFix if compiled at the end of those kernel gaps.

* The code is perfectly cross-compatible with other versions of CTR, however
the VRAM positions for each kart texture may not match those in other versions,
so the mod is marked as incompatible. Feel free to test that or add in the other
positions, though!
