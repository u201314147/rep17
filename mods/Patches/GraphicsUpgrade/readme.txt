Tested in USA Retail, might work in all builds

This imports the OverrideMPK code to make all drivers the 
highest LOD possible in the game, even in 4-player mode.

In 1P and 2P modes, level geometry is upgraded by preventing
LOD drops in geometry

All Multiplayer modes have "DecalMP" disabled, this is where
the drivers would render to a lower resolution than the window,
so now all drivers render to the full resolution of the game
